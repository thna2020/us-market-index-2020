### Overview

2020 was a year of uncertainty and financial hardships, even more so with a sudden major stock market crash caused by the coronavirus that began on February 20th, 2020 and ended on April 7th. Therefore, it may be worth investigating some major stock indices to gauge the magnitude of the impact inflicted by the pandemic on the US stock market.

Nasdaq Composite (~3000 stocks), S&P 500 index (500 stocks), and the Dow (30 stocks) are known as major stock market indices measuring the performance of a stock market, or a subset of the stock market. Each calculation for an index varies because each covers different stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (ticker symbol ^IXIC) is a stock market index that includes almost all stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The composition of the Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted towards companies in the information technology sector. The Nasdaq-100, which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the Nasdaq Composite, accounts for over 90% of the movement of the Nasdaq Composite.

The Standard and Poor's 500, also known as the S&P 500 (ticker symbol ^GSPC), is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of the 500 largest listed companies in the United States. It is widely followed for being one of the best representations of the US stock market and economy. The 10 largest companies in the index, in order of weighting, are Apple Inc., Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet Inc., Tesla, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Johnson & Johnson.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average or simply the Dow (ticker symbol ^DJI) is a stock market index of 30 large listed companies in the United States, where the number 30 is because few American stocks existed when the index was created in the late 1800s. 

In sum, the Nasdaq Composite is for tech, S&P 500 index is for a broad understanding of the US economy, and the Dow measures the movements of the leading companies in the United States that engage in industrial activities.
