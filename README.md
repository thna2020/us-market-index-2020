# The NASDAQ Composite, S&P 500 and the Dow in 2020 #

In this project, I use Python libraries Pandas and Matplotlib to compare performance of the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 index, and the Dow in 2020. Historical data are sourced from MarketWatch, a subsidiary of Dow Jones & Company and a property of News Corp.
