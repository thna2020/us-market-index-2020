This project, conducted with Python and its data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, evaluates and compares performance of the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 index, and the Dow in 2020. Historical data are sourced from MarketWatch, a subsidiary of Dow Jones & Company and a property of News Corp.

### Overview

2020 was a year of uncertainty and financial hardships, even more so with a sudden major stock market crash caused by the coronavirus that began on February 20th, 2020 and ended on April 7th. Therefore, it may be worth investigating some major stock indices to gauge the magnitude of the impact inflicted by the pandemic on the US stock market.

Nasdaq Composite (~3000 stocks), S&P 500 index (500 stocks), and the Dow (30 stocks) are known as major stock market indices measuring the performance of a stock market, or a subset of the stock market. Each calculation for an index varies because each covers different stocks. The Nasdaq Composite (ticker symbol ^IXIC) is a stock market index that includes almost all stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The composition of the Nasdaq Composite is heavily weighted towards companies in the information technology sector. The Nasdaq-100, which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the Nasdaq Composite, accounts for over 90% of the movement of the Nasdaq Composite.

The Standard and Poor's 500, also known as the S&P 500 (ticker symbol ^GSPC), is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of the 500 largest listed companies in the United States. It is widely followed for being one of the best representations of the US stock market and economy. The 10 largest companies in the index, in order of weighting, are Apple Inc., Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet Inc., Tesla, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Johnson & Johnson.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average or simply the Dow (ticker symbol ^DJI) is a stock market index of 30 large listed companies in the United States, where the number 30 is because few American stocks existed when the index was created in the late 1800s. 

In sum, the Nasdaq Composite is for tech, S&P 500 index is for a broad understanding of the US economy, and the Dow measures the movements of the leading companies in the United States that engage in industrial activities.

The federal holiday, which dates back to 1885, occurs on the third Monday of February. U.S. exchanges are closed for Presidents Day 2020, which falls on February 17 this year. The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and bond markets will resume trading at their normal hours on Tuesday, February 18.

### Data Analysis

![Data Analysis](images/DA_1.jpg)
Line chart communicates a stock’s price action very quickly and simply without any significant detail. As a long-term investor, you want your price chart rising from bottom left to top right. That means the stock is rising in price over time. As a short-term investor staying in a stock for weeks or months, you still want the same price action, but you’re looking to exit before the long-term investor does.

Why is a Stock’s Closing Price Significant? A stock’s closing price that determines how a share performs during the day. The close price is considered the reference point for any time frame. It’s the price traders agreed on after all the action throughout the day. When researching historical stock price data, most will use the closing price as the standard measure of the stock’s value as of a specific date. Especially, a stock’s closing price on December 31 in any year is also the closing price for not only that day, but also that week, month, quarter, and year.

The Nasdaq Composite is as old as the exchange and is different from another popular index, the Nasdaq-100. The Nasdaq-100 comprises of the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange and accounts for over 90% of the movement of the Nasdaq Composite.

At the same time, around 80% of the companies in the Nasdaq-100 are also in the S&P 500. That hasn't always been the case. Fifteen years ago, the overlap was less than 50%.
